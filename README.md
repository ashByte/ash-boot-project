# Boots Bootique

## Description
A dazzling new shop, the _Boots Bootique_, is set to open their flagship store on Spring Street this summer. However, they've got no way to manage all their inventory just yet! The store owns a vast collection of boots of all different sizes, types, materials, and quantities. 

## Objective
For this project, we won't have to touch the code in the front-end. All that we'll do is use Spring Data JPA to complete the functionality for the Boots API so that the front-end can:

- **C**reate new boots
- **R**ead and search the boots in the inventory
- **U**pdate the number of any given boot in the inventory
- **D**elete boots from the inventory

## Tasks

### TG1: Boot Up!

#### 1 (explore workspace)
In the browser, you'll see that we have a front-end prepared. We'll be using this front-end to interact with our Spring Boot Boots API. If you try to use any of the buttons on the screen right now, you'll get an error, as the API does not have that functionality implemented just yet.
